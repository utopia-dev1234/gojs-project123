Hi [Hiring Manager],

I'm excited to apply for the GoJS/Canvas development position. I've built 
extensive experience in workflow and mind-mapping canvas systems, with a 
strong focus on AI-accelerated development and clean UI/UX.

Step 1️⃣ — Portfolio Links:
1. Visual Canvas Suite: [live link]
   GitHub: github.com/utopia-dev1234/visual-canvas-suite
2. [Your second project]

Step 2️⃣ — Recommendation:
I recommend a HYBRID APPROACH. Rather than pure GoJS extension or complete 
rewrite, I propose parallel development with gradual migration. This preserves 
your existing strategies while modernizing the tech stack with React Flow.

Benefits:
• Lighter, faster performance
• Lower ongoing costs (no GoJS license)
• Easier to integrate AI features
• More accessible to modern developers
• Better mobile experience

See detailed analysis: [link to APPLICATION_GUIDE.md]

Step 3️⃣ — AI & UI/UX:
• ~85% of my development uses AI assistance (Copilot, Claude, Cursor)
• 10+ years UI/UX experience
• Expert in modern React patterns and canvas-based systems
• Examples: [link to projects with screenshots]

I've built the Visual Canvas Suite in [X hours] to demonstrate my ability 
to rapidly prototype production-quality canvas systems using AI-accelerated 
development techniques.

I'd love to discuss how I can help evolve your visual thinking tools!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
GitHub: github.com/utopia-dev1234

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Server won't start?**
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Port 3000 in use?**
Edit `vite.config.js` and change the port number.

**Blank page?**
Check browser console (F12) for errors.

**Packages missing?**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install
```

## 💡 Tips for Demo

**When Recording:**
1. Start with Mind Map (most intuitive)
2. Show adding nodes and connections
3. Demonstrate zoom and pan
4. Switch between canvas types
5. Show save functionality
6. Highlight smooth animations

**Talking Points:**
- "Built with React Flow, not GoJS, showing modern alternatives"
- "AI-accelerated development means rapid iteration"
- "Clean UI/UX with professional polish"
- "All four canvas types they requested"
- "Production-ready, scalable architecture"
