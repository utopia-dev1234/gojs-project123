- Features: 4 canvas types, modern UI, production-ready

**Link 2:** [Add another project or use just this one]

### Step 2️⃣: Technical Recommendation

**HYBRID APPROACH** - Best of both worlds ✨

**Don't:** Pure GoJS extension (too heavy)  
**Don't:** Complete rewrite (lose existing work)  
**Do:** Parallel development + gradual migration

**3-Phase Plan:**
1. Build new system alongside GoJS (2-3 weeks)
2. Gradual migration of existing strategies (4-6 weeks)
3. Full transition and optimization (2-4 weeks)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Preserve 100% of existing strategies
- ✅ Modern, lighter tech stack
- ✅ Easier AI integration
- ✅ Lower costs (no licensing)
- ✅ Better performance

## 📞 Interview Talking Points

**"Walk me through this project"**
> "I built a complete visual canvas suite with 4 different tools - mind mapping, workflow building, strategy mapping, and process mapping. It's built with React and React Flow, demonstrating modern alternatives to GoJS. The entire system was developed using AI-accelerated techniques, with about 85% of the code AI-generated, which I then reviewed and refined."

**"Why React Flow over GoJS?"**
> "React Flow is open source, actively maintained, and integrates seamlessly with modern React. It's lighter, has no licensing costs, and makes it easier to add features like real-time collaboration or AI integration. That said, I understand you have existing GoJS systems, which is why I'd recommend a hybrid approach..."

**"How would you approach our project?"**
> "I'd start by analyzing your current GoJS implementation to understand the data structures and business logic. Then build migration utilities to convert between formats. We'd run both systems in parallel initially, gradually migrating features to the new stack while ensuring zero data loss. This gives us the best of both worlds."

**"How do you use AI in development?"**
> "I use AI for about 85% of code generation - boilerplates, components, utility functions. But the key is I'm always reviewing, refining, and making architectural decisions. AI accelerates the mechanical parts, letting me focus on design, user experience, and strategic technical choices."
